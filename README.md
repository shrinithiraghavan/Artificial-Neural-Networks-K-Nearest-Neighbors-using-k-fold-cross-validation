Two different datasets are used in this project -

SGEMM GPU Kernel Performance
Classification of gilled Mushrooms

The datasets can be downloaded from the following URLs:
1. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SGEMM+GPU+kernel+performance
2. https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification (or) https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom

The main goal of the project is to understand the applications of Artificial Neural Network model & K-Nearest Neighbors model, how they can be built and how they influence the model performance. The analysis on the above datasets is done using Python and the code can be run sequentially in Jupyter Notebook.
